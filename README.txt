# Project: student admin
-------------------------------

## About

- creating a form with input field, that take student data such as name, age, major and email.

- the enter date then will be saved in browser local storage for letter data pick use or display 

- the data will display as a card list in grid format 

-------------------------------

## notes 

- creating delete feature to each student data card, by using 
local storage with key, there no need to add id parameter to get 
the desire card element. 
by using id parameter at Card component and and at CardList component 
attech the key value to the id by doing so each card will get the number of the place its in the localstorage. this will make the delete feature easy 
to implament.

-------------------------------
